# Merchant-Website Project

This project is a complete eCommerce website that allows users to create an account, login, and make purchases. The backend of the website is built using PHP, while the database is managed using MySQL and phpMyAdmin. The website also utilizes the PayPal API for payment processing and the PHP mail function for sending confirmation and purchase summary emails.

In addition to the customer-facing functionality, the website also includes a dashboard for administrators (webmasters) to access information about suppliers, customers, and an overview of the website's performance over the year (with the use of ChartJs). Administrators also have access to the stock of products. The administrator can add, modify, delete, and search for items in these tables.

This project is being undertaken as part of my university curriculum at the IUT Nice Cote d'Azur.
